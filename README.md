Resources for breaking into the Cloud-native space

### Starting off

- You'll need to learn some basics before jumping into the deep stuff. I recommend starting with a docker tutorial:
  - [Good Docker Tutorial](https://devopswithdocker.com/part-3/section-1)
  - Complete parts 1-3. There is pretty good coverage of important topics.
- We use `git` day in and day out. Understanding how it works is super important. There are very ( very ) few books on technical topics that are A. not out of date and B. not a waste of time. However, `Pro Git v2` is a FANTASTIC refernce and best of all it's free. I would read everything in this book except chapters 8,9, and 10. If you're feeling curious, those chapters are interesting, but you wont need that information for the job.

- We are a python and Go shop so knowing one of the two languages is a necessity. We need more golang experience so I would read `Let's Go Further` by Alex Edwards. I would read this book and follow along with the examples `cover to cover`. We use the patters described in this book a ton and I thuroughly enjoyed reading it and learned a ton.

### More advanced

- If you've completed the three resources listed above you can dive into the more complicated stuff such as "Kubernetes the Hard way". This project will teach you the basics of building a kubernetes cluster. If you're able to finish this, you'll have a great foundation for starting on the team.
